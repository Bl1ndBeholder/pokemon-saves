This is a backup of my Pokemon Game saves. Currently covering generations 1-7
Notes:
Anyone is free to use any of these save files. I run my backup script every time i finish playing which syncs my game saves with this repository.
as such every game will have saves at different checkpoints throughout the game - perfect if anyone needs to capture footsage a specific game section.
Usage:
clone this repository - git clone https://github.com/Bl1ndBeholder/pokemon-saves.git
The save files are saved as a timestamp (DDMMYYYYHHMM.sav)
these will need renaming to "romname.sav"
eg: If your pokemon emerald rom is named "Pokemon-Emerald-EU.gba" your save file needs renaming to "Pokemon-Emerald-EU.sav"
By default mgba and melonDS use the rom directory for saves. however, you can set any directory for save files. simply place the renamed .sav in the directory.
for 3ds saves - save direcories are generated when first launching the game.
For example - launch Pokemon X once and exit the emulation.
In Azahar/Citra/Lime3ds right click on the Alpha Sapphire Game.
Select - open -> Save Data Location
Copy or move the Alpha Sapphire .sav
*IMPORTANT* 
Rename the 3ds .sav file to "main"
